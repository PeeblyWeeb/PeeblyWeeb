I write in python, lua & javascript.
I occasionally do web development, recently in svelte.

I like to write Discord bots a lot, if you want one, feel free to ask.

..or if you'd like access to my private one, shoot me a dm and i'll probably give you an invite link

Contact me:
- [Discord (peeblyweeb)](https://discord.com/users/904032786854346795)
- [Email (peebly+ghcontact@salamithecat.com)](mailto:peebly+ghcontact@salamithecat.com) - I don't check my emails often, consider using Discord instead.

I'm free to collaborate on any projects, as long as they sound fun.
