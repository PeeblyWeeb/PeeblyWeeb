I write in python, lua & javascript and I occasionally do web development, recently in svelte.

I keep most of my work private until I feel it is in a presentable or at the very least functional state, so you won't see too much here. If you're interested in seeing those projects, contact me with the details I've listed below.

Contact me:
- [Discord (peeblyweeb)](https://discord.com/users/904032786854346795)
- [Email (peebly+ghcontact@salamithecat.com)](mailto:peebly+ghcontact@salamithecat.com) - I don't check my emails often, consider using Discord instead.

I'm free to collaborate on any projects, as long as they sound fun.
